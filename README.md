This is a Big Data Engineering Project on Azure. Data will be ingested from 2 data sources and ingested into the Data Lake in Azure. In the Data Lake, after a couple of data transformation and Machine Learning Model running, the Machine Learning result back to the Data Lake. Then Azure Synapse is used to connect to the Data Lake, and generate a report from the Synapse.
